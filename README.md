# CRUD-Application
This is a basic web-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed to manage product inventory. The user can add, view, update, and delete product records, including product codes, names, quantities, and prices.

How It Works:
1.Form Submission:
The form allows users to input the product details like Product Code, Product Name, Quantity, and Price.
On submitting the form, the entered data is displayed in a table below the form.

2.CRUD Operations:
Create: New products are added by filling the form and clicking the "Submit" button.
Read: All the products are listed in the table after submission.
Update: Users can edit existing product records by clicking the "Edit" button next to a record.
Delete: Products can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button next to the corresponding record.
